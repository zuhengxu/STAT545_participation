# stat545_md_explorer
A repository for exploring version control and mark-down

we can edit the readme.md file by using markdown syntext

I this repo will be renewed after each class and some useful resources might be added to it.

## Markdown exploration 
##### about how to edit `.md` file 
Here is some markdown notes I've taken in class01 and before.
* [how to insert a math equation](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/Markdown%20Math%20equations.md)
* [how to build lists](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/lists.md)
* [a macdown template provided by Macdown](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/markdown%20template.md)
* [note teken in class02](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/md%20explorer/md%20explorer.md)


## R markdown
##### about using Rmardown and editing `.rmd` files 
* [r markdown practce in class03](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/cm_003/in%20class%20excercise_sep11.Rmd) 
but it's wired that we cannot see the output of `.rmd` on github
* [a `.r` script about basic r syntex and command](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/cm_003/cm003-in%20class%20exercise-R.r)
