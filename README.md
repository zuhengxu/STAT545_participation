# Stat545_participation

Hi, welcome to Zuheng(David) Xu's [@zuhengxu](https://github.com/zuhengxu) repo about stat545 in class participation.

Generally ,this is repository for exploring version control and mark-down.

This repo will be renewed after each class and some useful resources might be added to it.

## Markdown exploration 
##### about how to edit `.md` file

## R markdown
##### about using Rmardown and editing `.rmd` files 
* [r markdown practce in class03](https://github.com/zuhengxu/STAT545_participation/blob/master/cm_003/in%20class%20excercise_sep11.Rmd) 
but it's wired that we cannot see the output of `.rmd` on github
