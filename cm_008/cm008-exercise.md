`mutate()`
----------

Let's get:

-   GDP by multiplying GPD per capita with population, and
-   GDP in billions, named (`gdpBill`), rounded to two decimals.

Notice the backwards compatibility! No need for loops!

Try the same thing, but with `transmute` (drops all other variables).

The `if_else` function is useful for changing certain elements in a data frame.

Example: Suppose Canada's 1952 life expectancy was mistakenly entered as 68.8 in the data frame, but is actually 70. Fix it using `if_else` and `mutate`.

Your turn: Make a new column called `cc` that pastes the country name followed by the continent, separated by a comma. (Hint: use the `paste` function with the `sep=", "` argument).

These functions we've seen are called **vectorized functions**.

`summarize()` and `group_by()`
------------------------------

Use `summarize()` to compute the mean and median life expectancy using all entries:

Do the same thing, but try:

1.  grouping by country
2.  grouping by continent and country

-   Notice the columns that are kept.
-   Notice the grouping listed above the tibble, especially without a call after grouping.
-   Notice the peeling of groups for each summarize.

Question: What if I wanted to keep the other numeric columns (gdpPercap, pop)? Can I? Would this even make sense?

For each continent: What is the smallest country-wide median GDP per capita?

Note that ggplot2's grouping is different from dplyr's! Try making a spaghetti plot of lifeExp over time for each coutry, by piping in a grouped data frame -- it won't work:

Your turn! For each continent, what is the median GDP per capita of countries with high (&gt;60) life expectancy vs countries with low (&lt;=60)? Sort this data frame by median GDP per capita.

There are special functions to summarize by. Let's see some of them:

-   `n()`: Number of rows in the group.
-   `n_distinct()`

Convenience functions:

-   `tally()` (= `summarize(n = n())`)
-   `count(...)` (= `group_by(...) %>% tally()`)

n\_distinct: How many years of record does each country have?

count

Function types
--------------

Let's stop to identify some theory of function types, and the `dplyr` approach to them.

<table style="width:32%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="9%" />
<col width="8%" />
<col width="6%" />
<col width="6%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Function type</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
<th>Examples</th>
<th>In <code>dplyr</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Vectorized functions</td>
<td>These take a vector, and operate on each component independently to return a vector of the same length. In other words, they work element-wise.</td>
<td><code>cos</code>, <code>sin</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>round</code></td>
<td><code>mutate</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Aggregate functions</td>
<td>These take a vector, and return a vector of length 1</td>
<td><code>mean</code>, <code>sd</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>typeof</code></td>
<td><code>summarize</code>, esp with <code>group_by</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Window Functions</td>
<td>these take a vector, and return a vector of the same length that depends on the vector as a whole.</td>
<td><code>lag</code>, <code>rank</code>, <code>cumsum</code></td>
<td><code>mutate</code>, esp with <code>group_by</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For any generic output, we can use dplyr's `do()` function -- but that's a topic for STAT 547.

Grouped `mutate()`
------------------

Calculate the growth in population since the first year on record *for each country*. `first()` is useful.

Notice that `dplyr` has retained the original grouping.

How about growth compared to `1972`?

Make a new variable `pop_last_time`, as the "lag-1" population -- that is, the population from the previous entry of that country. Use the `lag` function.

Similar: `lead` function.

Notice the NA's.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Your turn: Use what we learned to answer the following questions.

1.  Determine the country that experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in life expectancy, in each continent.

2.  Compute the relative gdp (NOT per capita!) of each country compared to Canada (= GDP of a country / GDP of Canada).

Sanity check: are Canada's numbers = 1? What is the spread of numbers like (should be small)?

Summary of major one-table functions
------------------------------------

-   `select()`
-   `filter()`
-   `arrange()`
-   `mutate()`
-   `summarize()`

Together with `group_by()` and "twists" of the above.

Practice Exercises
------------------

Practice these concepts in the following exercises. It might help you to first identify the type of function you are applying.

1.  Convert the population to a number in billions.

2.  Compute the change in population from 1962 to 1972 for each country.

3.  Rank the continents by GDP per capita. You should have two columns: one with continent, and another with the ranking (1 through 5). **Hint**: use the `rank()` or `min_rank()` function.
