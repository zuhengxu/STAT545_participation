## Reading and Writing Data: Exercises

Make a tibble of letters, their order in the alphabet, and then a pasting of the two columns together.

```{r}
tibble(let= letters, 
       num=1:length(letters),
       comb=paste(let,num))
```

Make a tibble of three names and commute times.

```{r}
tribble(
  ~name, ~time,
  "Frank",30,
  "Lisa",15,
  "Fred",40
)
```


Write the `iris` data frame as a `csv`. 

```{r}
write_csv(iris,"iris.csv")
```

Write the `iris` data frame to a file delimited by a dollar sign. 

```{r}
write_delim(iris,"iris.txt",delim="$")
```

Read the dollar-delimited `iris` data to a tibble.

```{r}
read_delim("iris.txt",delim="$")
```

Read these three LOTR csv's, saving them to `lotr1`, `lotr2`, and `lotr3`:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Two_Towers.csv
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv

```{r}
lotr1=read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv")
lotr2=read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Two_Towers.csv")
lotr3=read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv")
```

## `gather()`

(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [gather tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md))

This function is useful for making untidy data tidy (so that computers can more easily crunch the numbers).

1. Combine the three LOTR untidy tables (`lotr1`, `lotr2`, `lotr3`) to a single untidy table by stacking them.  

```{r}
(lotr_untidy=bind_rows(lotr1,lotr2,lotr3)) #the gender and race has some problem
```

2. Convert to tidy. Also try this by specifying columns as a range, and with the `contains()` function.

```{r}
gather(lotr_untidy ,key="Gender",value="Word",Female,Male)
gather(lotr_untidy ,key="Gender",value="Word",Female:Male)
gather(lotr_untidy,key = "Gender",value="Word",contains("ale"))
``` 

3. Try again (bind and tidy the three untidy data frames), but without knowing how many tables there are originally. 
    - The additional work here does not require any additional tools from the tidyverse, but instead uses a `do.call` from base R -- a useful tool in data analysis when the number of "items" is variable/unknown, or quite large. 

```{r}
lotr_list=list(lotr1,lotr2,lotr3)

lotr_list

do.call(bind_rows,lotr_list) #do.call(f,l)<=>f(l1,l2,l3) 
```

## `spread()`

(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [spread tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/03-spread.md))

This function is useful for making tidy data untidy (to be more pleasing to the eye).

Read in the tidy LOTR data (despite having just made it):

```{r}
lotr_tidy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/lotr_tidy.csv")
```

Get word counts across "Race". Then try "Gender". 

```{r}
spread(lotr_tidy,key= "Race",value="Words")
```

Now try combining race and gender. Use `unite()` from `tidyr` instead of `paste()`. 

```{r}
lotr_tidy %>% 
  unite(Race_Gender,Race,Gender) %>% 
  spread(key="Race_Gender",value="Words")

lotr_tidy %>% 
  mutate(x= rnorm(nrow(lotr_tidy))) %>% 
  spread(key="Gender",value="x")
```

## Other `tidyr` goodies

Check out the Examples in the documentation to explore the following.

`expand` vs `complete` (trim vs keep everything). Together with `nesting`. Check out the Examples in the `expand` documentation.

```{r}
expand(mtcars, vs, cyl)
df <- tibble(
  year   = c(2010, 2010, 2010, 2010, 2012, 2012, 2012),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    1,    2,    3),
  return = rnorm(7)
)
df %>% expand(year, qtr)
df %>% expand(year = 2010:2012, qtr)
df %>% expand(year = full_seq(year, 1), qtr)
df %>% complete(year = full_seq(year, 1), qtr)

experiment <- tibble(
  name = rep(c("Alex", "Robert", "Sam"), c(3, 2, 1)),
  trt  = rep(c("a", "b", "a"), c(3, 2, 1)),
  rep = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1),
  measurment_1 = runif(6),
  measurment_2 = runif(6)
)

experiment %>% 
  expand(nesting(name,trt),rep)
```

`separate_rows`: useful when you have a variable number of entries in a "cell".

```{r}

```

`unite` and `separate`.

```{r}

```

`uncount` (as the opposite of `dplyr::count()`)

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(x = c("a", "b"), n = c(1, 2))
uncount(df,n)

```


`drop_na` and `replace_na`

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA), y = c("a", NA, "b"))
df %>% drop_na()
df %>% drop_na(x)

```

`fill`

```{r}

```


`full_seq`

```{r}

```


## Time remaining?

Time permitting, do [this exercise](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md#exercises) to practice tidying data.
