## Install `nycflights13` package

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(nycflights13))
```

## Types of mutating join

### Let's join tibbles using four mutating functions:  `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join` and `full_join`.

### create two tibbles named `a` and `b`

```{r}
a = tibble(x1 = LETTERS[1:3], x2 = 1:3)
a
b = tibble(x1 = LETTERS[c(1,2,4)], x3 = c("T", "F", "T"))
b
```

### left_join: Join matching rows from `b` to `a` by matching "x1" variable

```{r}
left_join(a,b,by="x1")
```

### right_join: Join matching rows from `a` to `b` by matching "x1" variable.

```{r}
right_join(a,b,by="x1")
```


### inner_join: Join data. Retain only rows in both sets `a` to `b` by matching "x1" variable.

```{r}
inner_join(a,b,by="x1")
```


### full_join: Join data. Retain all values, all rows of `a` to `b` by matching "x1"

```{r}
full_join(a,b,by="x1") # combine boith 2
```


### what happen if we do not specify `by` option?

```{r}
left_join(a,b) 
```

### what happen if we join two different variables (e.g., "x1" to "x3") from two tibbles `a` to `b`?

```{r}
left_join(a,b,by=c("x1" = "x3"))
```


### what happen if two columns of `a` and `c` datasets have the identical colnames?

```{r}
# make data frame c and use inner_join()
(c <- tibble(x1 = c(LETTERS[1:2],"x"), x2 = c(1,4,5)))
left_join(a,c)
```

## In class practice

`nycflights13` dataset has several tibbles e.g., `flights`, `airports`, `planes`, `weather`.

### 1. Explore `nycflights13` dataset

```{r}
#check the tibbles included in `nycflights13` package
class(flights)
dim(flights)
colnames(flights)
head(flights)

colnames(airlines)

colnames(weather)
head(weather)
dim(weather)
```

### 2. Drop unimportant variables so it's easier to understand the join results. Also take first 1000 rows to run it faster.

```{r}
flights2 <- flights[1:1000,] %>% 
  select(year, tailnum, carrier, time_hour)
flights2

```

### 3. Add airline names to `flights2` from `airlines` dataset.

```{r}
# Which join function to use?
colnames(flights2)
colnames(airlines)
head(airlines)
dim(airlines)

# will repeat automatically
left_join(flights2,airlines,by="carrier")
```

### 4. Add `weather` information to the `flights2` dataset by matching "year" and "time_hour" variables.

```{r}
#when a single var can't define a data, different days can have same time_hour
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(weather, by = c("year","time_hour")) 

```

### 5. Add `weather` information to the `flights2` dataset by matching only "time_hour" variable

```{r}
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(weather, by = "time_hour")
```

## Types of filtering join

### Let's filter tibbles using two filtering functions: `semi_join`, `anti_join` 


### example for `semi_join`: All rows in `a` that have a match in `b`

```{r}
#return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.

#A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of x.
semi_join(a,b)
inner_join(a,b)

```


### example for `anti_join`: All rows in `a` that do not have a match in `b`

```{r}
anti_join(a,b) # return a  not in b

```


### example of joinin by matching two variables (e.g., "x1", "x2") from both datasets `a` and `c`

```{r}
a
c
semi_join(a,c)
```


## Types of Set Operations for two datasets

### Let's use three `set` functions: `intersect`, `union` and `setdiff` 

### create two tibbles named `y` and `z`, similar to Data Wrangling Cheatsheet

```{r}
(y <-  tibble(x1 = LETTERS[1:3], x2 = 1:3))
(z <- tibble(x1 = c("B", "C", "D"), x2 = 2:4))
```

### example for `intersect`: Rows that appear in both `y` and `z`

```{r}
intersect(y,z)
```

### example for `union`: Rows that appear in either or both `y` and `z`

```{r}
#why it's upside down
union(y,z)

```

### example for `setdiff`: Rows that appear in `y` but not `z`. __Caution:__ `setdiff` for `y` to `z` and `z` to `y` are different.

```{r}
# like A\B and B\A
setdiff(y,z)
setdiff(z,y)
```


### what happen if colnames are differentin `y` and `x`? Is there any error message and why?

```{r}
(x <- tibble(x1 = c("B", "C", "D"), x3 = 2:4))

#intersect(y,x)
#union(y,x)
```

## Types of binding datasets

### Let's bind datasets by rows or column using two binding functions:

### example for `bind_rows`: Append `z` to `y` as new rows

```{r}
bind_rows(y,z)
rbind(y,z)
```


### example for `bind_cols`: Append `z` to `y` as new columns. __Caution__: matches rows by position. Check colnames after binding.

```{r}
#interesting things happen when looking at the class function

bind_cols(y,z)
cbind(y,z)
class(bind_cols(y,z))
class(cbind(y,z))

data<-cbind(y$x1,z$x2)
class(data)
View(data)
```

### what happen if colnames are different between `y` and `x` datasets?

```{r}
bind_cols(y,x)
```


##Practice Exercises
Practice these concepts in the following exercises. It might help you to first identify the type of function you are applying.


### 1. Filter the rows of `flights2` by matching "year" and "time_hour" variables to `weather` dataset. Use both `semi_join()` and `anti_join()`

```{r}
# we can use it as a filter function
semi_join(flights2,weather,by=c("year","time_hour")) 
anti_join(flights2,weather,by=c("year","time_hour")) 
```

### 2. Can we apply `set` and `binding` funcions between `flights2` and `weather` datasets. Why and why not?

```{r}
#we can apply binding but not set functions since the number of their cols don't match

bind_rows(flights2,weather)
#intersect(flights2,weather)
#union(flights2,weather)

```


### 3. Let's create a tibble `p` with "x1" and "x2" coulmns and have duplicated element in "x1" column. Create another tibble `q` with "x1" and "x3" columns. Then apply `left_join` function `p` to `q` and `q` to `p`. 

```{r}
(p = tibble(x1 = c("B","B", "C", "D"), x3 = 1:4))
(q = tibble(x1 = c("B","C","C","D"), x3 = 5:8))
```

```{r}
left_join(p,q)
left_join(q,p)
```
